=head1 NAME

FastCGI::NativeCall::Async - An asynchronous wrapper for FastCGI::NativeCall

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code

use FastCGI::NativeCall::Async;

my $fna = FastCGI::NativeCall::Async.new(path => "/tmp/fastcgi.sock", backlog => 32 );

my $count = 0;

react {
    whenever $fna -> $fcgi {
        say $fcgi.env;
        $fcgi.Print("Content-Type: text/html\r\n\r\n{++$count}");
    }

}

=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The rationale behind this module is to help
L<FastCGI::NativeCall|https://github.com/jonathanstowe/raku-fcgi-nativecall>
play nicely in a larger program by managing the blocking accept loop as
a Supply that can for instance be used in a C<react> block as above.
It doesn't actually allow more than one FastCGI request to be processed at
once for the same URI as the protocol itself precludes that.  However it
does allow more than one FastCGI handler to be present in the same
 program, potentially sharing data and other resources.

The interface is very simple and much of the functionality is delegated
to L<FastCGI::NativeCall|https://github.com/jonathanstowe/raku-fcgi-nativecall>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 method new

    method new(FastCGI::NativeCall::Async:U:  Str :$path, Int :$backlog = 16)

The constructor must be supplied with the path where the listening Unix domain
socket will be created, the location must be accessible to both your program
and the host HTTP server which will be delivering the requests.

The C<backlog> option, which defaults to 16, is the number of yet to be
accepted requests that can be queued before subsequent requests receive
an error, you may want to adjust this (in concert with the configuration
of your host HTTP server,) to achieve an acceptable level of throughput
for your application.

=head2 method Supply

    method Supply(FastCGI::NativeCall::Async:D: --> Supply)

This returns a L<Supply> on to which the L<FastCGI::NativeCall> object
is emitted for each incoming request. This acts as a coercion on the
FastCGI::NativeCall::Async object so may not need to be typed explicitly
in some places (such as in a C<whenever> of a C<react> block as in the
Synopsis.)

This method, when first called, creates a thread that runs the normal
C<Accept> loop of FastCGI::NativeCall in the background, any subsequent
calls will return the same supply fed with the same data.  To end the
loop use C<done> described below.

=head2 method promise

    method promise(FastCGI::NativeCall::Async:D: --> Promise)

This is the promise that is provided by starting the underlying thread,
it will not be defined until C<Supply> has been called.  It will be
kept when the thread completes after C<done> is called.

=head2 method done

    method done(FastCGI::NativeCall::Async:D:)

This terminates the loop started when C<Supply> is first called,
afterward the Supply will no longer be fed with new requests.
When the thread has completely finished the Promise returned
by C<promise> will be kept.

After this has been called you will need to create a new object
to commence responding to requests as the FastCGI object will
have been closed.
